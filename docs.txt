yarn global add live-server
=> we will need to see the html js output again and again 
> we will use expres ffor our production, livescript while we are developing and webpack for localhost 

Use live-server public for seeing the output of everything in public folder
right now we are using script tag to insert react react dom redux but later we will use webpack for it which is easy
react allows  us to create js code which creates components => components are the html codes 
=> to render/insert this html to DOM, we use react-dom library

create app.js which will create all the react or js code => and include this file in the html

JSX is JS XML which is extension for JS just like we have SAAS as extension for CSS

If we create a JSX code and try to render it inside html code like by inserting in div => it will show error 
=> this is because, the JSX code is not understood by the browser => we use babel for that

babel is a Javascript compiler. It helps us in many conversions -
1) JSX to plain old js => like needed here
2) ES6/ES7 to ES5 => ES6/6 comes with variety of new features like arrow function but these wont work on every browser because there are still some browser who dont support it yet and maybe never will 
=> for browser compatibility, we must convert ES6/7 anywhere in our code to plain old js => i,e, we maybe wrting Es6 but it will convert to Es5 in the end => and we know it can run everywhere

On babel website you can see conversion 
React.createElemet (tag name, attribute array, content ) 

=> but we want to automate this conversion and thus we will use babel library for that locally 
=> replace jsx by its equivalent code for old js given by babel 
and it works fine 

now we will install the babel and some of its presets => we will install react preset, the env preset which helps in getting us all es6 and es7 features
yarn global add babel-cli => comamnd line to access babel
babel --help 

Like in node, we used npm init for config of the project, here it is the yarn which does all that work like adding dependencies or init 
=> yarn init before every project

Now we will add the presets as dependency in package.json using the yarn module yarn add babel-preset-react

Now lets create app.js in src folder => this is js file where we will write our JSX code => then using babel commanline we will convert this code into old javascript code by outputing it into scripts/app.js
In commandline => babel src/app.js --out-file=public/scripts/app.js --presets=env,react

If we use this with --watch => it will keep running in background and make changes as we make any changes

We dont upload node modules on git or anything => to reinstall them on your machine, do yarm install just like we did npm install in node
